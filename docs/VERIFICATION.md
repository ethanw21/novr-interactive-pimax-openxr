# Reproducible verification

The portable suites run with **.NET SDK 8** and **Python 3.10 or newer**. They
compile selected production source without a game installation, Unity assemblies,
a headset, or a packaged NOVR DLL:

```sh
python tools/verify.py portable
```

If .NET is not on `PATH`, supply its executable explicitly:

```sh
python tools/verify.py portable --dotnet /path/to/dotnet
```

For a focused change, list suite names and select only the relevant ones:

```sh
python tools/verify.py portable --list
python tools/verify.py portable --suite gaze-cue
python tools/verify.py portable --suite cockpit-map --suite cockpit-map-input
```

`--list` needs only Python. Repeat `--suite` to select several suites; each runs
once in registry order. Unknown names are errors. Focused reports go to
`artifacts/verification/portable-focused/` and are marked as partial verification,
so they do not replace the full-run summary. `--output` overrides either location.
Run the full portable command before submitting a change.

`tools/verification/global.json` selects a stable SDK 8 feature band even when
newer SDKs are installed. Restore uses only the public NuGet feed and the package
versions declared in each test project. No game paths are autodetected. Each
project has isolated build imports; the runner rejects assembly references,
project references or imports that would silently pull in the game build.

Without `--suite`, the command runs every registered suite and returns a
nonzero exit code if any fails. Read individual logs and JSON/Markdown summaries
under `artifacts/verification/portable/`; use `--verbose` to print passing output.
Every portable invocation, including focused runs and listing, checks the entire
registry for missing, duplicate or unregistered projects and validates isolation.
It also checks that linked source and embedded resources are present and inside
this repository, rejecting missing resource globs and binary dependencies.

These are executable check programs, so the runner uses `dotnet run` rather than
`dotnet test`. It trusts exit status, not a fixed assertion count or expected log
string. Some suites exercise pure math; others compile production components
against small Unity/game boundary doubles. HUD profile persistence uses real
temporary BepInEx config files; cockpit seat/handle profile checks use in-memory
configuration doubles. The HUD session fixture links the actual coordinator and
both profile stores, with rendering/contact endpoints and in-memory configuration
replaced at their boundaries. Installer service checks use real transactions in
temporary directories, including an older pending request racing a newer install;
same-version and partial-install repairs remain supported. Installer UI checks replace OS pickers and file/network
operations; they do not open the native desktop dialogs. None of these doubles
supplies a rendered game scene.

The runner's regression tests require only Python:

```sh
python -m unittest discover -s tools/verification -p "test_*.py"
```

## GitHub Actions

`.github/workflows/portable-checks.yml` runs the same command on Ubuntu and
Windows for pushes, pull requests and manual dispatch. Its sparse checkout
includes the source and controller/glove artwork needed by these suites,
excluding the repository's Unity/native binaries. It runs the Python runner
regressions before the portable suites. It uploads verification logs, not build
binaries or game files. Jobs have read-only repository permission and never
deploy the mod.

A separate **SDK 10 package-safety job** runs on both operating systems using
`python tests/Installer/check_build.py`. Its smaller sparse checkout contains
only build definitions/task source, the fixture and package notices. It creates
synthetic assemblies in a temporary directory to check current-output staging,
generated XR payloads, missing-game diagnostics, deployment and installer
publication opt-in, version matching, package metadata/checksums and rejection
without overwriting a previous package.
It records the installer's child publication commands instead of executing them.
It never builds or installs the runtime mod or needs game/native binaries.

`.github/workflows/build-mod.yml` is the only workflow that builds the runtime
mod. It runs for each pushed commit and on manual dispatch. The mod compiles
against the game's managed assemblies, so the job downloads the Nuclear Option
Dedicated Server with anonymous SteamCMD and uses its `Managed` assemblies as
compile-time references. They are never committed, cached or uploaded, and the
job fails if any of them appears in the package. It then runs the documented
`NOVR.Build` package command and uploads the unpacked package as one artifact
named `NOVR-<version>-<commit>`, with the layout of `NOVR.zip`. The optional
native foveation backend is not built. A passing run shows that the source
compiles against the server's assemblies. It does not start the game or the mod.

A passing Linux run does not prove Windows passed; both matrix results need to
be checked in GitHub Actions. Local test output cannot establish that a hosted
workflow ran successfully.

## Optional local assembly contracts

After building the runtime locally against your installed game, explicitly opt
into its compatibility checks:

```sh
python tools/verify.py contracts \
  --plugin /path/to/built/NOVR.dll \
  --managed /path/to/NuclearOption_Data/Managed
```

This reads the supplied assemblies with Mono.Cecil. It runs the core checks
plus the embedded asset and patch/field compatibility checks. Reports are kept
separately under `artifacts/verification/contracts/`. It does not launch the
game, install a package, send game input, or upload local assemblies. Do not add
private game files or hardcoded installation paths to CI to make this check run.
`--suite` and `--list` apply only to portable verification; contracts always runs
the complete core/assembly contract program.

The SDK 10 package-safety check can also run locally with
`python tests/Installer/check_build.py /path/to/sdk10/dotnet`. It remains
separate from the SDK 8 portable command and the local assembly contracts.

## Runtime evidence still needed

The [FS-20 interaction matrix](FS20_INTERACTION_TEST_MATRIX.md) is a historical
record for the retired 0.4.7.5 replacement-panel experiment, not a current runtime
acceptance checklist. Its private probes and removed MFD harness are not run by
the portable command.

Portable checks and assembly contracts do not prove stereo appearance, rendered
occlusion, interaction comfort, haptic feel, multiplayer behavior or frame-time
performance. Verify those in the running game with a clearly recorded build,
aircraft, settings and device path. Keep synthetic interaction tests isolated
from online sessions, restore their settings afterward and remove temporary
diagnostic plugins before a normal play session.
