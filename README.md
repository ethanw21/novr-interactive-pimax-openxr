**A note from the maintainer:**

> Most of my contributions are AI-assisted. I’m not an experienced developer; I’m focused on creating a passable VR implementation while learning. This is an unofficial experiment intended as a stopgap, and I’m looking forward to the forthcoming official implementation from Shockfront. I’m doing my best to respect the game’s design and preserve the character of its excellent vanilla and modded aircraft.

Experimental version **0.4.8.32**. Targets Nuclear Option **0.34.6** and PC VR through OpenXR. Original cockpit displays stay in use. All aircraft share the FS-20 stick and grip; helicopters use a native collective lever instead of the plane throttle. The maintainer has tested Windows PC streaming with Steam Frame and Quest 3 through Steam Link.

## Install

Download the experimental package from [Releases](https://github.com/SilentHeron/novr-interactive/releases). The Windows and Linux installers also accept a downloaded `NOVR.zip` through **Install a downloaded NOVR package…**.

1. Close the game. In Steam, right-click Nuclear Option → **Manage → Browse local files** to open the folder containing `NuclearOption.exe`.
2. Download **BepInEx 5 for Windows x64** (`BepInEx_win_x64_5…zip`) from [BepInEx releases](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases). Copy the archive's contents directly into that game folder, so `winhttp.dll`, `doorstop_config.ini` and `BepInEx` sit beside `NuclearOption.exe`.
3. Extract the contents of `NOVR.zip` into that **BepInEx** folder. You should now have `BepInEx/plugins/NOVR/NOVR.dll` and `BepInEx/patchers/NOVR/NOVR.Patcher.dll`.
4. **Linux/Proton only:** add `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winhttp=n,b" %command%` to the game's Steam launch options. Keep other options; merge an existing `WINEDLLOVERRIDES` value and use `%command%` only once.
5. Connect your headset to its PC VR runtime, then press **Play in Steam**. NOVR uses DirectX 11; a launch on another renderer restarts once automatically.

**On Linux, you still need Windows BepInEx:** Nuclear Option runs as a Windows game through Proton. BepInEx has no separate installer `.exe` to run; it loads when the game starts. The Linux BepInEx package and its `run_bepinex.sh` are for native Linux games. The optional **NOVR Linux installer** is a different tool and chooses Windows BepInEx for you.

This replaces upstream NOVR; do not install both. The installer does not change Proton launch options. DirectX 11 also applies on Linux: Proton translates it to Vulkan through DXVK. If automatic startup fails, replace any other renderer flag with `-force-d3d11`. Use `-novr-flat` for an intentional non-VR launch.

## Default controls

These buttons assume the flight stick is in your right hand. Left-handed mode moves role-based actions with the stick/throttle, using the corresponding buttons on that controller; the View menu button stays on the physical left. Custom bindings are retained. Edit them under **View → Controller bindings** or **Settings → Controls → Visual VR Controller Bindings**.

| Action | Steam Frame | Quest / Touch | Valve Index | Context |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Guns | Right trigger | Right trigger | Right trigger | Stick held |
| Selected weapon release | A | A | Right A | Stick held |
| Select target nearest cue | Right thumbstick click | Right thumbstick click | Right thumbstick click | Stick held |
| Unselect latest target | B | B | Right B | Stick held |
| Next weapon | Y | Y | Left B | Frame: stick held; Touch / Index: throttle held |
| Deploy countermeasures | Left D-pad down | X | Left A | Throttle held |
| Next countermeasure type | Left D-pad right | Left thumbstick click | Left thumbstick click | Throttle held |
| Wheel / air brake | Left trigger | Left trigger | Left trigger | Throttle held |
| Nozzle tilt / wing sweep / pusher fans | Left thumbstick up/down | Left thumbstick up/down | Left thumbstick up/down | Throttle or collective held |
| Map / respawn | B | B | Right B | Stick hand free, or spectating; press again to close |
| VR View menu | Left View | Left Menu, or wheel → VR MENU | Left trackpad press, or wheel → VR MENU | Either grip state for button; free hand for wheel |
| Quick wheel | Either thumbstick click | Either thumbstick click | Either thumbstick click | That hand free |
| Reopen layout menu | Either thumbstick click | Either thumbstick click | Either thumbstick click | Edit layout active |

Valve Index controllers are detected automatically and use their own preset. Their system buttons belong to the VR runtime, so View opens with a firm press on the left trackpad; with strapped-on controllers, open your hand and close it on a handle to grab it. This preset has not yet been confirmed on real hardware. [Index details](docs/CONTROLLER_BINDINGS.md#valve-index-controllers).

Target selection and cycling act on button release; guns, weapon release, countermeasures and brakes are held actions. A white outline marks a handle within grab range (15 cm by default). Grip grabs it; **View → Flight controls** offers Hold or Toggle for each. **F7:** motion controls. **F8:** place handles. **F9:** View in the cockpit; map outside it.

For a persistent manual Ibis pusher-fan setting, turn Flight Assist off; enabled assist resumes native automatic control. For wing sweep, push the thumbstick forward to extend the wings or backward to sweep them aft.

**Quick wheel:** deflect to highlight; return to center to select. Click again to cancel. In flight, trigger changes Options / Weapons pages. **GAME MENU** opens the game's menu; **VR MENU** opens NOVR settings, including when Steam Link consumes the Quest Menu button. Eject requires a centered stick-click hold for 1.2 seconds; release to reset, or tilt / press trigger to cancel.

**Outside an aircraft:** thumbstick click opens a wheel with **VR MENU**, **GAME MENU** and **OPEN MAP / CLOSE MAP**, including while dead, waiting to spawn or spectating. **B** also toggles the map on Frame, Quest and Index with the default right-handed layout (left-hand Y on Quest, left B on Index, when mirrored). Closing the map returns to the same spectator target.

**Spectating:** a full VR view follows the selected unit from the game’s normal external camera distance. Right stick orbits; left stick up/down moves closer/farther. Center the sticks after menus to resume camera control. The spawn map and aircraft-selection pages keep their normal presentation and controls.

**Minimap:** touch its face with a free fingertip to select it. While holding the flight stick, use the **physical right thumbstick** to pan and click to select an eligible target at the crosshair. Touch the face again to disengage and recenter on your aircraft, keeping zoom. After disengaging, center the thumbstick and release its click before normal flight bindings resume. Touch **+ / −** to zoom. In layout editing, two opposite corners adjust width and height independently without stretching the map.

**View → Edit layout:** reach a widget with your fingertip and grip to move it; throttle and stick placement uses the same edit mode. Tilt a held widget to adjust pitch/yaw; roll stays locked. Grab opposite corners with both hands to move, tilt and resize together. Labels, outlines and corner handles appear only while editing. Touch the eye to hide/show a widget, or its pencil for appearance sliders; surrounding widgets dim temporarily. Notifications and Instructions also offer **Text size** (65–150%) here and in **View → Widget appearance**. **Click either thumbstick to reopen the layout menu**, then save or cancel everything together. Each aircraft has three independent slots for its seat, handles and HUD layout. Existing layouts stay in Slot 1.

For a physical HOTAS, turn **View → Flight controls → Motion controls** off and bind your hardware in the game's control settings. HUD widgets and layout editing remain available; editing keeps virtual flight controls off.

**Wrist widgets:** in Edit layout, grip a panel with one hand and hover it over the other wrist. A white outline, haptic tick and **Release to attach** show when it's ready; release your grip to attach. Pull it away and release to place it back in the cockpit. Save the aircraft slot to keep changes. Wrist panels appear when you check them and hide when looking away or opening that hand's quick wheel. Hiding a wrist map also ends map control and recenters it. Unsaved layouts start in left, center and right groups below eye level.

**Auxiliary controls:** the aircraft's complete native nozzle, wing-sweep or fan gauge is a movable HUD frame, including its diagram. Adjust it through **View → Edit layout**. Only the fitted gauges are shown.

**Head clearance:** enabled by default with a 25 cm radius; adjust it from 5–40 cm in View settings. It cuts only eligible seat geometry near your head. Saved settings are retained when upgrading.

**Foveated rendering (experimental):** available on native Windows with compatible NVIDIA hardware and Direct3D 11. View → VR performance → Foveated rendering has a strength slider for fixed or eye-tracked use. Extreme and Maximum test smaller protected regions and coarser peripheral shading; MSAA limits the outer rate to 2×2. **Follow eye tracking** uses supported OpenXR gaze, including Steam Frame; missing tracking uses a fixed fallback. Foveation, eye tracking and GPU measurements default to Off. The same package works on Linux/Proton with foveation unavailable. [Details and comparison steps](docs/PC_FOVEATION.md).

**Game graphics:** View → VR performance → Game graphics adjusts the game's tree distance, shadow quality and cloud detail. Lower settings can help in scenes heavy with trees, shadows or clouds. Existing settings stay unchanged until you adjust them.

## Build

With .NET SDK 8 and Nuclear Option installed (BepInEx is needed to run the mod):

```sh
dotnet build NOVR/NOVR.csproj -c Release -p:DeployToGame=false
dotnet build NOVR.Patcher/NOVR.Patcher.csproj -c Release -p:DeployToGame=false
```

The full solution needs SDK 10. Building does not install the mod. Optional installer executables require `-p:PublishInstallers=true`.
